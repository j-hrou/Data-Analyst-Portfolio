# Edinburgh Airport Revenue Analysis

## Overview

This project focuses on critical revenue analysis for Edinburgh Airport (EDI), simulating the role of a Revenue Analyst. It encompasses two key areas: assessing the profitability and performance of EDI's car parking facilities, and accurately calculating the rebate due to a partner airline, FlyFar, based on their contractual incentives. This project showcases my ability to analyze complex financial datasets, derive key performance indicators, and present actionable insights essential for strategic revenue management within an airport environment.

## Project Goals

The primary objectives of this project were to:

* **Analyze Car Parking Profitability:** Understand trends and profitability across various car parking options, identifying key metrics for performance evaluation.
* **Calculate Airline Rebate:** Precisely determine the incentive rebate owed to FlyFar airline according to contractual terms, ensuring financial accuracy.
* **Develop Clear Financial Insights:** Translate raw transactional and contractual data into clear, formula-driven calculations and visualizations.
* **Support Revenue Management Decisions:** Provide a comprehensive view of revenue streams to inform operational and strategic financial planning.

## Key Analysis Areas

### Car Parking Revenue Performance

This section involved analyzing a year's worth of car parking data to provide a monthly overview of performance. The analysis focused on:

1.  **Profit Margin per Car Park:** Calculating and visualizing the profitability of each distinct car parking facility.
2.  **Profit per Space:** Determining the efficiency of space utilization in generating profit across car parks.
3.  **Average Transaction Value (Revenue):** Analyzing the average revenue generated per car park transaction.
4.  **Additional Insights:** Identifying and presenting any other valuable trends or metrics derived from the car parking data.

### FlyFar Airline Rebate Calculation

This task required a detailed calculation of the rebate value for FlyFar airline for their second year of operation, based on specific contractual terms. The key questions addressed were:

1.  **Overall Rebate Value and Incentive Breakdown:** Determining the total amount to be rebated to FlyFar, as well as the individual value of each incentive component.
2.  **Rebate per Departing Passenger:** Calculating the effective rebate given away for each departing passenger.
3.  **Overall Discount Off Tariff (Percentage):** Expressing the total discount provided for Year 2 as a percentage of the standard tariff.
