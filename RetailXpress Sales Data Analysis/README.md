# RetailXpress Data Visualisation Project

## Overview

This project involved analyzing a simulated dataset of sales information for the fictitious multinational retail company, "RetailXpress." My goal was to create insightful data visualizations to address key business questions, focusing on customer behavior, product strategy, and distribution optimization. This project showcases my ability to translate raw data into actionable insights for strategic decision-making.

## Project Goals

The primary objectives of this project were to:

* Analyze and understand the RetailXpress sales data.
* Develop clear and visually appealing visualizations to answer specific business questions.
* Present findings in a format accessible to a senior executive audience.
* Demonstrate proficiency in data visualization and storytelling.

## Business Questions Addressed

The project aimed to answer the following business questions:

1.  **Customer Analysis:** "Can you tell us more about our customers and their spending habits?"
2.  **Product Strategy:** "Which product categories should we continue to sell and which should we discontinue?"
3.  **High-Value Customer Strategy:** "Would it be beneficial to invest in a strategy to target high-value, high-risk customers to improve their satisfaction and reduce churn?"
4.  **Distribution Hub Strategy:** "If we were to create distribution hubs in countries to reduce shipping costs, which countries should we target? What effect will that have on our profit margins?"
