# Scottish Tourism Business Performance Dashboard

## Overview

This project involved the development of an interactive Power BI dashboard to visualize key performance indicators of Scottish tourism businesses. Utilizing data sourced from the Industry Statistics database on gov.scot, the dashboard provides stakeholders with a clear and concise overview of business unit numbers, employment figures, turnover, and Gross Value Added (GVA). The primary objective was to create a user-friendly tool that enables comparative analysis of different Scottish local authorities and tracks performance trends over time. This project showcases my ability to transform raw data into actionable insights through interactive data visualization.

## Project Goals
