# Scottish Tourism Day Visits Data Extraction Project

## Overview

This project focused on extracting and transforming relevant data from a large and complex survey dataset of day trips to Great Britain (approximately 104,000 rows) to create a simplified, analysis-ready table of tourism day visits to Scotland's regions. Utilizing SQL, I filtered and aggregated data to provide a clear and concise view of visitor demographics and trip characteristics for trips to Scotland's regions. This project demonstrates my ability to navigate and extract meaningful insights from substantial datasets using SQL for efficient data preparation and downstream analysis.

## Project Goals

The primary objectives of this project were to:

* Extract a refined dataset of tourism day visits to Scotland's regions from a large, complex survey dataset.
* Employ SQL to filter, aggregate, and transform the raw data into a structured and easily analyzable table.
* Create a simplified dataset suitable for further analysis and dashboard creation.
* Showcase proficiency in SQL for data extraction and manipulation in a real-world context.

## Dataset Description

The original dataset comprised approximately 104,000 rows of survey data, encompassing a wide range of information about tourism activities. Due to its complexity and size, direct analysis was challenging. This project aimed to distill this large dataset into a more manageable and targeted dataset that specifically focuses on tourism day visits to Scotland's regions.

## Project Structure

* **`data/`**: Includes a sample of the original raw dataset and  the SQL script used to extract and transform the data.
* **`outputs/`**: Contains the extracted, cleaned table in a suitable format (CSV).
* **`README.md`**: This document.

## SQL Extraction and Transformation Details

The SQL script within the `outputs/` directory was designed to:

* Filter the original dataset to include only records pertaining to tourism day visits within Scotland.
* Extract relevant columns, such as visitor demographics (age, region fo residence, number of childreen in household), trip details (region visited, main activity undertaken, transport used), and expenditure.
* Aggregate data to summarize key metrics, such as the life stage of visitors.
* Transform data to ensure consistency and facilitate analysis (e.g., standardizing region names, formatting dates).
* Create a new, simplified table that is suitable for analysis and dashboard creation.

## Tools Used

* **SQL:** Used for data extraction, transformation, and aggregation.
* **Database System:** Google BigQuery

## Skills Demonstrated

* **Advanced SQL Querying:** Proficiency in using SQL to filter, join, aggregate, and transform large datasets.
* **Data Extraction:** Ability to isolate relevant information from complex data sources.
* **Data Transformation:** Skill in cleaning and restructuring data for analytical purposes.
* **Data Aggregation:** Capacity to summarize data and derive meaningful metrics.
* **Database Management:** Experience in interacting with and manipulating data within a database environment.
* **Data Simplification:** Ability to distill complex data into a simplified, analysis-ready format.
